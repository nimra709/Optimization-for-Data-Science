# Optimization for Data Science

In this repository, my colleague, Nimra Nawaz, and I implemented the advanced and core concepts of Optimization algorithms such as Steepest Descent and quasi-newton method BFGS to explore the problem of estimating the matrix 2-norm as an unconstrained optimization problem taught by [Prof. Antonio Frangioni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W3pkToYAAAAJ&hl=en) in Optimization for Data Science course at Universit√† di Pisa for the year 2023/24.

# Project Description

**(P)** is the problem of estimating the matrix norm \( \| A \|_2 \) for a (possibly rectangular) matrix \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \), using its definition as an (unconstrained) maximum problem.

**(A1)** is a standard gradient descent (steepest descent) approach.

**(A2)** is a quasi-Newton method such as BFGS or L-BFGS.
